### New Blog

Hello and welcome. I've started this blog as a sort of outlet from the grind of grad school research life. New challenges always crop up, and I find myself scouring stack exchange, other blogs, and technical documentation to come up with solutions. Here, you'll find a collection of posts detailing my findings and insights. I hope you find them useful!

Enjoy!
