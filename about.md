title: About

I am a graduate student studying computational materials science. [Density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory "DFT Wiki") works really well for materials at absolute zero, but predicting materials properties at finite temperatures remains a big challenge. My interests involve extending first principles calculations to predict high temperature phase stability. Our groups technique of choice is the cluster expansion, which involves calculating interaction terms for atomic pairs, triplets and higher-body terms within a bulk material.  

I started this blog to provide a resource for other students and researchers who might run into the same technical issues that I do! Hopefully, youll find this blog helpful, and feel free to send me a message. 



## Bio 

Currently I am a graduate student advised by Professor Anton Van der Ven at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

In 2012 I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh where I majored in applied math and chemistry.

I live in Santa Barbara, and, when I'm not at at work, I am either riding my road bike, trying to learn new jazz tunes on guitar, or updating this blog.

Thanks for reading!
